# Basketball-Scoreboard

## Summary

- "Scrimba.com" challenge. where we have 2 basketball tables. 1 scoreboard belongs to the "HOME" team, and the other to the "Guest" team. Each has the possibility of 1, 2, and 3-point promotion. Accordingly, in case of clicking on a number intended for a specific team, points will be added to it, using an increment. If we want to clear the scores of both teams, we click on the "CLEAR" button.
